/**
 * Exercise:
 *  - Create a class called ElectricPetrolStation that provides a method void chargeVehicle(ElectricVehicle vehicle). This method should:
 *      - Accept only instances of vehicles that implement the ElectricVehicle interface.
 *      - Call the batteryLevel() method to check the current battery level before charging.
 *      - Simulate charging the vehicle by increasing the battery level (for simplicity, assume charging adds 10% to the battery, but does not exceed 100%).
 *
 *  - Modify the ElectricVehicle interface to allow updating the battery level of a vehicle.
 *
 *  - Create a class to represent Electric Buses manufactured by Volvo.
 *
 *  - Add code below to simulate a scenario where both a TeslaModelS and a Volvo Electric Bus go to an ElectricPetrolStation and get charged.
 *
 *  - Verify that you can not charge a Porsche911 car in the ElectricPetrolStation.
