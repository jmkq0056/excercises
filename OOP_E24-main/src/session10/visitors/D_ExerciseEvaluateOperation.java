/**
 * Exercise: Implementing an Evaluator Visitor to Evaluate Mathematical Expressions
 *
 * Background:
 * In this exercise, you will implement a visitor class named Evaluator that computes
 * the result of a given mathematical expression.
 *
 * Objective:
 * Your task is to create an Evaluator class that implements the visitor pattern to
 * compute the result of mathematical expressions, such as "4 + 3 - 2 = ", where the
 * expected result would be "5".
 *
 * Requirements:
 * 1. Evaluator Class:
 *    - Create a class named Evaluator.
 *    - Add the following fields to the Evaluator class:
 *      - int result: to store the accumulated result of the expression.
 *      - int currentInteger: to keep track of the last integer found when visiting the expression.
 *      - Node lastOperation: to track the last operation (e.g., addition, subtraction) found when visiting the expression.
 *
 * 2. Implementing Visitor Methods:
 *    - Implement the required visitor methods in the Evaluator class.
 *    - The main complexity will be in the visitor method associated with the Integer node. This method should check
 *      the last operation and update the final result based on the current visited integer.
 *
 * 3. Testing Your Implementation:
 *    - Test your Evaluator with various expressions to ensure it accurately computes the results.
 *    For example, for the input "4 + 3 - 2 =", the output should be "5".
